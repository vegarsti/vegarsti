### Hi!

I'm Vegard. I work at [Cognite](https://cognite.com). We're a SaaS company helping industrial companies digitize. Currently I'm working on a search API for documents. I use Python.

In my spare time, I'm currently trying to learn more about systems programming and programming languages, specifically Golang (see [my repos](https://github.com/vegarsti?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=go)).

Read [**my blog**](https://vegardstikbakke.com), where I write sometimes.

### Hi!

I'm Vegard. I work as a software engineer at [Dune](https://dune.com/careers), where I work on streaming ETL jobs for big datasets, and the automation and management of these.
I write a lot of SQL and Kotlin, and recently Python, and some Go.

I track things I learn at [til.vegardstikbakke.com](https://til.vegardstikbakke.com).

I have a [blog](https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/). My favorites are
- [Problem solving with Unix commands](https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/unix/)
- [How do Unix pipes work?](https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/how-do-pipes-work-sigpipe/)
- [I fixed a bug in Python!](https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/python-contribution/)

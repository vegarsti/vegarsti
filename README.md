#### Hi 👋🏻

I'm Vegard. I'm currently trying to learn more about systems programming and programming languages, among others [Golang](https://github.com/vegarsti?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=go). And I like to read.

I have a [website](https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/)! My favorite posts are
- [Problem solving with Unix commands](https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/unix/)
- [How do Unix pipes work?](https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/how-do-pipes-work-sigpipe/)
- [I fixed a bug in Python!](https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/python-contribution/)
- [Books I read in 2019](https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/books-2019/)

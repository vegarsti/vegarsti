### Hi!

I'm Vegard. I work as a software engineer at [Dune](https://careers.dune.com/), where I'm a heavy user of SQL and write code in Kotlin and Go. I'm currently trying to learn more about databases!

I track things I learn at [til.vegardstikbakke.com](https://til.vegardstikbakke.com).

I'm making a SQL database at [github.com/vegarsti/sql/](https://github.com/vegarsti/sql/).

I have a [website](https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/). My favorite posts are
- [Problem solving with Unix commands](https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/unix/)
- [How do Unix pipes work?](https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/how-do-pipes-work-sigpipe/)
- [I fixed a bug in Python!](https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/python-contribution/)
